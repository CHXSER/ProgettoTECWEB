        BOHEMY is an art society from Antartica with a passion for creating art, bringing fictional, imaginary worlds
        to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our art is inspired by the world around us, and we very much enjoy working with a
        variety of different mediums, including digital art, watercolor, and
        acrylics.
      </p>

        We are constantly exploring and discovering new thing about art, which
        makes us excited for the future as we continue to grow our own perspective
        and present interesting ideas to the world with a bohemian touch.

    <h2 class="heading">What is the bohemian style ?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The bohemian style is a vibrant and electric expression of creativity
        that embraces the unconventional. It is not bound by rules, often
        merging various art forms, cultures, and historical influences. It is
        characterized by rich patterns and vibrant colors while mixing the
        natural and surreal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To some, it expresses a celebration of individuality, freedom, and the
        joy of creating without boundaries. To others, it is an expression of
        experimentation, exploration, and a personal worldview aesthetic.
